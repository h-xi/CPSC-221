What makes a good maze? 

Consider a maze that begins as a bunch of adjacent rooms: 
    - Each room is a vertex 
    - Open wall = edge between vertex 


- Unpredictable, not easily solved 
- Highly branching, many dead ends 

- Just enough walls to get from any room to any other room 
    - Especially start and finish 

Construct a Spanning tree = Solution to maze :) 

Essentially --> utilize Kruskal's algorithm: 
    - Instead of a PQ, just select a random edge 
    - If edge is in disjoint set --> break; 
    - else join set.
