DFS: Visit each vertex, classifies each edge as DISCOVERY or BACK

RUNTIME = Theta(n + m) --> vertices + edges

One full Traversal of graph: 

For all vertices in graph --> set label to UNVISITED 
For all edges in graph --> set label to UNEXPLORED 

For all vertices, if label = UNVISITED --> DFS(G,V)


DFS Algos: 

Start at vertex v --> set label to visited 
For all adjacent vertices if UNVISITED --> edge = DISCOVERY 
    DFS(G, adjacent vertex)
else if edge = UNEXPLORED --> Set label as BACK
